# Testing Process 

# Testing Steps
1. Simple test plans steps : https://shantonusarker.blogspot.com/2012/12/how-to-prepare-test-plan.html

# Bugs
1. A Good Bug example : https://shantonusarker.blogspot.com/2012/09/a-good-bug-report.html
But, I should say, in agile world, this is based on team. Sometimes only 1 line or a sigle screen shot can express more than detail explanation. So, these are not hard rules. Principles are simple, convaying the problem to The team.
2. A Typical Bug Cycle : https://shantonusarker.blogspot.com/2012/12/what-is-bug-cycle.html
3. Bug Priority Basic, with example : https://shantonusarker.blogspot.com/2012/08/how-to-prioritize-bugs-in.html
